If you want to know more about me here is my cv.\r\n\r\n### About\r\nMy name is Jean Alesi Reynoso, I have 20 years and live in Lima, I'm a programmer who has over 4 years of experience in software development. I am currently working at Wunderman phantasia as a gardener(it's a joke!, work like Full stack developer).\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.",
